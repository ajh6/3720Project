Zoosaders!

Our game will be a simple charades game that uses both a random animal generator API and pygame.

When the user begins the game, a random animal will be generated, and a new timer will be started. If the user does not recognize the animal that was generated, they can skip to have a new animal generated, along with a new timer started. 

The rest of the rules are simple. Just act out the animal you get if you know what it is, and have fun.
